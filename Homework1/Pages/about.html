      Joseph Lubin is a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder of ConsenSys, a
      full-stack, global blockchain company. Lubin has established himself as a
      guiding force in the fast-growing blockchain industry and a powerful
      advocate of decentralized technology.
      <br />
      Founded in 2014, ConsenSys has cultivated a global presence, employing top
      entrepreneurs, computer scientists, protocol engineers, software
      developers, and experts in enterprise delivery. As one of the largest and
      most foundational entities in the blockchain technology space, ConsenSys'
      worldwide Mesh of people, projects and companies is building the
      blockchain industry's developer tools, decentralized applications, and
      solutions for enterprises and governments that determined to harness the
      power of Ethereum. The organization was referred to by The New Yorker in
      2018 as “the Ethereum community's most prominent and ubiquitous developer
      and promoter of decentralized apps.”
      <br />
      Born and raised in Toronto, Lubin graduated from Princeton University with
      a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He worked in the
      Princeton Robotics Lab at Tomandandy Music developing an autonomous music
      composition tool and at private research firm Vision Applications Inc.
      building autonomous mobile robots. As a software engineer and consultant,
      Lubin worked with eMagine on the Identrus cryptographic payments and trade
      finance network project and was involved in the founding and operation of
      a hedge fund. He held positions as Director of the New York office of
      Blacksmith Software Consulting and VP of Technology in Private Wealth
      Management at Goldman Sachs. Through these posts, Lubin focused on the
      intersection of cryptography, engineering, and finance.
      <br />
      Inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper and the potential of
      distributed systems to “shatter the silos of power and re-balance the
      information asymmetries that disadvantage so many,” Lubin delved into the
      incipient blockchain community. He was a primary figure in the creation
      and launch of Ethereum alongside fellow Torontonian Vitalik Buterin in
      2014, and eventually moved to build an ecosystem around the nascent
      technology, in part by launching ConsenSys.
      <br />
      “With Lubin's background in both tech and business, he quickly emerged as
      a key strategist and took the title of chief operating officer of the
      entity that would bring Buterin's vision to fruition,” stated Newsweek.
      “After that, things moved fast.”
      <br />
      The subsequent rise of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Ethereum has been
      one of the most remarkable stories in tech since 2016—a bonafide global
      phenomenon that resonates from hacker dens to Davos—and an entire industry
      has grown around decentralized networks and their associated digital
      assets.
      <br />
      “Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision,” Lubin told the New York
      Times in 2016. “Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver
      that vision.”
      <br />
      The Ethereum developer base, now in the hundreds of thousands, is an
      ardent community building with open source ideals and interoperable
      platforms in market segments ranging from supply chain to financial
      markets to intellectual property. Thousands of startups around the world
      are innovating new business models with Ethereum, and blockchain
      experimentation is now prevalent among the world's leading
      organizations—banks, central banks, governments, and tech giants alike.
      <br />
      ConsenSys has incubated over 50 projects, including key infrastructural
      elements of the Ethereum network like Kaleido's Blockchain-as-a-Service,
      MetaMask's Web3 onramp, Truffle's developer suite, PegaSys' mainnet
      client, and Ethereum network essentials like Infura and Alethio. ConsenSys
      also incubates platforms and applications across a wide variety of
      industries, such as komgo, an international trade financing platform, and
      Viant, a supply chain track and trace platform. ConsenSys has had close
      association with another 50 or so projects via investment or through
      services like security auditing or token launching. In 2018, Newsweek
      wrote that “The growth of ConsenSys, like the growth of Ethereum itself,
      has been explosive.”
      <br />
      ConsenSys has been a central figure in the establishment of the Enterprise
      Ethereum Alliance, a global standards organization for business
      applications of Ethereum technology. The EEA now has over 500 members,
      including global business leaders including Accenture, CME Group,
      Deloitte, Ernst&Young, Intel, banks like JPMorgan, Microsoft, Pfizer, law
      firms like Schulte Roth&Zabel LLP, T-Mobile, and Wipro. The Brooklyn
      Project and projects like the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum have led
      research and regulation in the United States and Europe, ensuring a more
      equitable blockchain industry.
      <br />
      ConsenSys has also been noted for its commitment to decentralized
      organization in addition to its myriad successful spinouts, projects, and
      initiatives. “The company structure is inspired by Lubin's utopian
      ideals,” states Newsweek. “Employees choose their own titles, and instead
      of a traditional deep hierarchy, there's a flatter, agreements-based
      governance structure, a decentralized system of management where power is
      distributed among self-organizing teams.”
      <br />
      By now, it's clear that blockchain technology will embed itself deep into
      the economic processes of the world. It's just a matter of when. Through
      these early stages in the era of blockchain and cryptocurrency, Joe Lubin
      has proven a steady hand amidst the volatility. With all roads leading to
      Ethereum 2.0 and a fully mature industry of blockchains, Lubin believes
      the Ethereum ecosystem has reached critical mass and velocity:
      “Entrepreneurs and technologists are pouring into the ecosystem to build
      out the decentralized world wide web, Web 3.0. Once you've seen the
      profound implications of blockchain, you can't unsee it. Each new wave of
      the hype cycle will bring larger and larger cohorts of builders and users.
      For these people, there is no turning back.”
